    "In this project, we propose an unsupervised approach to propagate the stance of posts in online discussions. We use a new algorithm with inspiration from  heat diffusion graph network -based approach  to propagate the stance of posts to their neighboring posts in a discussion graph. Our approach does not require labeled data, which makes it ideal for scenarios where labeled data is limited or unavailable. Our algorithm is able to handle cyclic conversions which makes it a best suit for platforms like Facebook or Twitter where actual debate takes place.\n",
