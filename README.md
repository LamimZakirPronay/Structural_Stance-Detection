Motivated by the need for identifying and propagating stances along 
debate threads where this correspondence can be elusive, we present a stance 
propagation model built on the Heat Diffusion algorithm, and show that it can 
effectively spread stances over the nodes of a debate thread. Our authors are 
represented by the nodes of our model, posts written are oriented to the edges in 
this case, data has been retrieved from the CreateDebate platform. The 
experimental results show that the proposed model achieves comparable 
performance as the current state-of-the-art models. This algorithm has shown to 
be very effective at growing stances in unsupervised settings and, as such, these 
results provide valuable insight into the evolution of online debates.
